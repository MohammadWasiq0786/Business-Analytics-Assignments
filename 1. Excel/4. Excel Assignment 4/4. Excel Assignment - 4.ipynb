    "<br> Example: Consider expenses of a person who will be entered in excel at the same time expenses must be evenly distributed among all people with the amount of money each person should return/ receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** String formatting in Excel is performed using the CONCATENATE function or the ampersand operator (&). The CONCATENATE function is used to join two or more strings together, while the ampersand operator can be used to concatenate strings and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some examples of how to perform string formatting in Excel :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the CONCATENATE function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following data in cells A1 and B1:\n",
    "\n",
    "A1: \"John\"\n",
    "\n",
    "B1: \"Doe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To concatenate these two strings, you can use the CONCATENATE function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`=CONCATENATE(A1, \" \", B1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce the output \"John Doe\", with a space between the two strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the ampersand operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can achieve the same result using the ampersand operator as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`=A1 & \" \" & B1`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also produce the output \"John Doe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concatenating strings with values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following data in cells A1 and B1:\n",
    "\n",
    "A1: \"John\"\n",
    "\n",
    "B1: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "To concatenate the string in A1 with the value in B1, you can use the ampersand operator as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`=A1 & \" is \" & B1 & \" years old\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce the output \"John is 25 years old\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using cell references:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use cell references to concatenate strings in Excel. Suppose you have the following data in cells A1 and B1:\n",
    "\n",
    "A1: \"John\"\n",
    "\n",
    "B1: \"Doe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "C1: \"Full Name:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To concatenate the strings in A1 and B1 with the string in C1, you can use the ampersand operator as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Enter the Roll Number and Name of the students in cells A2 and B2 respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "`=SUM(C2:D2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add the marks obtained in Subject 1 and Subject 2 to give the total marks.\n",

    "\n",
    "`=(E2/200)*100`\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the total marks for each subject is 100, we divide the total marks obtained by 200 (100 + 100) and multiply it by 100 to get the percentage.\n",

    "7. To format the percentages to show two decimal places, select the column containing the percentages (column F), right-click, and select \"Format Cells\". In the \"Number\" tab, select \"Percentage\" and set the decimal places to 2.\n",
